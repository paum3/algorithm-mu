# Workshops - Algorithmic Music with Functional Programming 
Workshop documents about algorithmic music with functional programming. Concepts of functional programming based on Haskell will be introduced and the possibilities of composition and music creation with code will be demonstrated.

## Order of presentations

1. Overview about algorithmic music (15 min)
2. TidalCycles (105min)
3. CSound (120min)
4. Euterpea (?)
5. More?!
